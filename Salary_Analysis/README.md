# Employee Salary Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of employee salary information. The dataset includes details such as age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary for employees in various positions. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights about salary distribution, experience levels, and the impact of education on income.

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [Salary Data - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data).

## Why I Chose This Project

I selected this dataset and project because I am passionate about understanding factors that influence salaries across different demographics and job roles. The dataset provides a rich set of information, which allows for various interesting analyses, such as:

- The effect of education and experience on salary.
- Gender-based salary discrepancies.
- Insights into job roles with higher salaries and how they correlate with experience levels.

Additionally, salary analysis is highly relevant in both organizational and personal contexts, helping individuals and companies make informed decisions regarding career paths, salary expectations, and workforce management.

## Key Insights Learned

Through this project, I have learned to apply various SQL techniques to explore and analyze data, uncovering meaningful patterns and relationships. Specifically, I gained experience in:

- Writing complex SQL queries to analyze data in-depth, such as finding average salaries, comparing salary distributions across different demographics, and identifying trends based on job roles and experience levels.
- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis, including handling irregularities like decimal values in fields that should be integers.
- Gaining a better understanding of how factors like education and years of experience influence salary distributions across industries.

The analysis provides valuable insights that could help organizations understand salary trends and make informed decisions regarding employee compensation.
