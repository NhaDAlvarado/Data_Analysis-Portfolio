# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects where I perform end-to-end analyses, from data exploration and cleaning to in-depth analysis and visualization. Each project includes a detailed `README.md` that outlines the goals, datasets, methods, and key insights.

## Portfolio Overview

Here, you'll find an array of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis and visualization, using tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau. Each project focuses on real-world datasets, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights and present them visually for better understanding.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- End-to-end analytical workflows
- Insights and recommendations based on analysis

## Projects

Each project has its own folder containing:

- **Data**: The dataset used in the analysis (if publicly available or a link to the source).
- **Notebooks/SQL**: Jupyter notebooks, SQL scripts, or code files showing the step-by-step analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Dashboards or visualizations created using Tableau, Python, or other tools.
- **Detailed ReadMe**: A project-specific `README.md` providing an in-depth explanation of the project goals, process, and results.
