# Bike Store Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike store sales data in Europe using **Microsoft Excel**. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/data), contains valuable information about sales trends, customer purchases, and product performance.

## Why Excel?

As a data analyst, I recognize that **not everyone is familiar with SQL or coding-based analytics**. Many managers, business executives, and non-technical stakeholders prefer tools that allow them to **visually interact** with data. Excel provides an intuitive interface with **pivot tables, charts, and formulas** that enable effective data exploration and reporting.

By conducting this analysis in Excel, I ensure that insights can be easily **understood, shared, and acted upon** by a broad audience.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I:

- **Refined Excel skills**: Used pivot tables, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and data visualization techniques to summarize key trends.
- **Identified sales trends**: Explored seasonal trends, top-performing products, and customer purchasing behaviors.
- **Developed actionable insights**: Generated business recommendations based on sales performance and customer segments.
- **Improved data storytelling**: Created clear and engaging reports that effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and structured data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used pivot tables to summarize key metrics (e.g., total sales, average order value, product performance).
3. **Data Visualization**: Created charts (bar, line, and pie charts) to visualize trends and comparisons.
4. **Business Insights & Recommendations**: Derived meaningful insights for business growth and sales optimization.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Pivot tables, formulas, charts, and conditional formatting.
- **Power Query (if applicable)**: For advanced data transformation and automation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Excel can be a powerful tool for **sales analysis and decision-making**. By making data accessible and visually engaging, businesses can drive more informed strategies without needing technical expertise.
