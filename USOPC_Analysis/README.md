# USOPC Sport Benefits Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the home interview process for the **Associate Sport Technology & Data Analyst** position at the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC).

The goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize how the USOPC allocates resources directly to athletes and in support of athletes through 56 National Governing Bodies (NGBs). The project highlights funding insights, organizational metrics, and potential opportunities through interactive data storytelling using **Tableau**.

## 📚 Background

Since 2019, the USOPC has published annual _Sport Benefits Statements_ for each NGB. These reports provide a transparent overview of resource distribution, specifically within:

- **High-Performance Programs**
- **Athlete Training Facilities**

For this project, the following data sources were provided:

- `Sport Benefits Statements Data.xlsx`: Aggregated data covering High-Performance Programs and Athlete Training Facilities.
- `NGBHealthDataOutput Extract.csv`: Supplemental background data including NGB membership, staffing, and revenue information. _(Note: This dataset is incomplete and requires thoughtful cleaning.)_

Additional external data such as medal counts or financial records from the sports industry could also be used to enhance the analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze funding trends across all NGBs.
- Identify patterns and potential disparities in resource allocation.
- Visualize insights through Tableau to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Create an educational resource that breaks down part of the project for non-technical learners.
