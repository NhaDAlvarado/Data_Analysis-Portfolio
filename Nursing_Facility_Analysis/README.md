# 🏡 Medicare Nursing Facilities Analysis (2014)

This project dives into the 2014 Medicare data on certified nursing facilities across the United States, hosted on **Google BigQuery’s Public Datasets**. Using SQL for data exploration and **Tableau** for storytelling, I aimed to uncover insights about facility quality, staffing, ownership, and resident care across different states and provider types.

## 📌 Why I Chose This Project

As someone passionate about healthcare analytics, I wanted to explore a dataset that touches on both **care quality** and **public accountability**. Nursing facilities play a crucial role in long-term elder care, and the variation in their performance affects thousands of families across the country.

I chose this project because:

- It lets me **analyze real-world healthcare data** with direct impact on quality of life.
- I wanted to explore **staffing, ownership type, and facility ratings** to see what factors influence good care.
- It gave me an opportunity to practice **working with BigQuery** on large public datasets and **visualizing results in Tableau**.

## 🔍 Questions I Explored

1. **How does ownership type (for-profit vs non-profit) affect quality ratings?**
2. **Which states have the highest or lowest-rated nursing facilities?**
3. **Do staffing levels (RN, CNA, LPN hours) correlate with better care?**
4. **Which facilities have the most deficiencies or complaints?**
5. **What are common patterns in facilities with high vs low ratings?**

## 📊 Insights and Key Findings

- **For-profit nursing homes** had a lower average star rating compared to **non-profit and government-owned** facilities.
- States like **Alaska and North Dakota** had higher average facility ratings, while **Texas and Louisiana** tended to score lower.
- Higher **RN hours per resident per day** were associated with **better quality ratings**, reinforcing the importance of skilled staffing.
- **Deficiency counts** were noticeably higher in facilities with lower staffing levels and lower star ratings.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use **BigQuery** to explore structured healthcare datasets at scale.
- The role of **CMS quality metrics** and how they’re tied to facility-level data.
- How to build a **narrative-driven Tableau dashboard** to communicate healthcare insights clearly.
- How ownership structure and staffing investment can directly influence resident experience.
