# Car Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes car sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights in the automotive industry. Using a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report/data), this project dives into key metrics such as sales performance, brand popularity, and market segmentation.

## Why This Project?

As someone passionate about data analysis and storytelling through visualizations, I wanted to work on a dataset that is both relatable and rich in business insights. The car sales dataset is perfect because:

- **Personal Interest**: Cars and their sales trends are fascinating, reflecting broader consumer behavior and economic conditions.
- **Practical Relevance**: Understanding market dynamics in industries like automotive can be a transferable skill across sectors.
- **Skill Development**: It allows me to hone my data analysis and visualization skills using tools like SQL, Python, and Tableau.

## Objectives

Through this project, I aim to:

1. Analyze car sales data to identify top-performing brands and models.
2. Explore regional and temporal sales trends.
3. Provide actionable insights for improving sales strategies.
4. Practice and showcase my data storytelling capabilities.

## What Will I Learn?

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and handling inconsistencies in real-world datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns and trends using statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating compelling dashboards and visual reports in Tableau.
- **Insights Presentation**: Drawing actionable insights from data to inform business decisions.
- **Technical Skills**: Enhancing proficiency in Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Car Sales Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report/data)
- **Description**: This dataset contains detailed records of car sales, including brand, model, sales volume, and other attributes.
- **File Name**: `car_data.csv`

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the data.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and advanced analysis.
- **Tableau**: For interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Understanding**: Exploring the dataset to grasp its structure and key attributes.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Analysis and Insights**: Generating meaningful insights using EDA.
4. **Visualization**: Designing dashboards that effectively communicate findings.
5. **Documentation**: Summarizing results and learning outcomes in a clear, concise manner.

## Results and Key Insights

(Here you can add insights once you analyze the dataset, such as "Brand X dominates the market in Region Y" or "Seasonal trends indicate peak sales in Q3.")

## Future Scope

- Expanding the analysis to include predictive modeling for future sales.
- Incorporating external data such as economic indicators or fuel prices for deeper insights.
- Enhancing visualizations for better storytelling.
